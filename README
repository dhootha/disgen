Zion is a script to build a distribution based on the Linux From Scratch
book available at http://www.linuxfromscratch.org

Note: Most commands are commented as I test things out. If you want to try
it out, make sure you uncomment the function calls in paths.sh

To generate:

    $ ./paths.sh <folder>

The script currently ends by sticking you in a chroot environment. Once in
there, run the postchroot.sh script:

    $ ./postchroot.sh
