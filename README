Zion is a script to build a distribution based on the Linux From Scratch
book available at http://www.linuxfromscratch.org

Note: Most commands are commented as I test things out. If you want to try
it out, make sure you uncomment the function calls in paths.sh and packages.sh

First enter a clean shell by running env.sh:

    $ ./env.sh

Now to generate the temporary tools, run:

    $ ./paths.sh <folder>

The script currently ends by sticking you in a chroot environment. Once in
there, run the postchroot.sh script:

    $ ./postchroot.sh

This should drop you into a named shell (bash-4.2$). Now just run packages.sh
within this shell:

    $ ./packages.sh

That's it! The folder you specified should contain the filesystem image for
your LFS system.

Note that the packages.sh file is still incomplete and only works till section
6.17 in the LFS 7.1 book.
